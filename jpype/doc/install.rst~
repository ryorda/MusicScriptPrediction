Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Either the Sun/Oracle JDK/JRE Variant or OpenJDK. Python 2.6+

Debian/Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debian/Ubuntu users will have to install ``g++`` and ``python-dev``
first:

::

    sudo apt-get install g++ python-dev

Installation
------------

Should be easy as

::

    python setup.py install


If it fails...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This happens mostly due to the setup not being able to find your
``JAVA_HOME``. In case this happens, please do two things:

1. You can continue the installation by finding the ``JAVA_HOME`` on
   your own ( the place where the headers etc. are) and explicitly
   setting it for the installation:

   ``JAVA\_HOME=/usr/lib/java/jdk1.6.0/ python setup.py install``
2. Please create an Issue `on
   github <https://github.com/originell/jpype/issues?state=open>`__ and
   post all the information you have.
